            <p>
              Vaanya worked on the astrophysics and data interpretation parts of
              ExoQuest, mainly focusing on the scientific validation of the
              machine learning models. She combined astronomical context into
              the analysis pipeline, which ensured the data processing, feature
              extraction and model outputs aligned with astrophysical
              principles. In the ExoQuest team, Vaanya worked on understanding
              and refining the stellar light-curve data, calibrating the models
              for better precision, and verifying that the predictions match the
              behaviors of exoplanets.
